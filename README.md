# WebScrappers
These are several web scrappers that I have made. They work for a few websites. They take in the specified information requested in the code and then puts it in to a nice .csv file for your viewing convenience. You can edit the code to allow the program to fetch you different information. 

Requirements: 
 - Python 3.5 
 - Selenium 
 - BeautifulSoup 
 - Chromedriver (if you are using Google Chrome)
 
For the LinkedIn scrapper, you will have to edit the code so that it sends in your email login and your account password. You will also need to download chromedriver if you are using Google Chrome and you need to put it's download path in the program(s) as well. You can find where to do all of that in the code.
